# Factorio AI v0.18.00+

Currently the project is in a very WIP state. Current features include
- Walk to ore deposit using A* pathfinding 
- Place structures
- Mine resources 

This project was inspired by submitteddenied's meta-factorio series, however because it stopped development over 2 years ago I decided to work on one of my own, with my own touch to it. One of the current noticeable differences is instead of using a "feeler" the mod will automatically calculate an optimal path using A* pathfinding.
